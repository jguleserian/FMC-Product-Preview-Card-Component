## My process

### Workflow:

1. Set up folders and file structure, set up README.md, create GitHub repo and link it to VS Code 
2. Determine strategy for structuring the page
3. HTML: set major structure with containers, placing the general content within them
4. HTML: starting from the top with each major container, assign content to individual elements and arrange them as necessary.
5. HTML: link and place <picture> and <img> / <source> files as necessary. Set media query sizes as necessary or once breakpoints are established.
6. CSS: set up.
  - "Pencil in" the major structure using GPS: "reset & variables," "containers," "elements," "classes & ids," "media queries"
  - Write the CSS for the page reset in the ":root," <html>, <body>, and *. I generally put in the variable for colors, font, etc. at this time.
  - Set the media queries, adding in a change of background color so I can visually identify what query I am viewing and to have an element in the query as a placeholder
7. Starting from top to bottom in the HTML, set the CSS styles for each element. 
8. Code the style/add hover states and animation as necessary
9. Code the JavaScript if necessary.
10. Clean up code
11. Test functionality, responsiveness, and similitud with original model in Figma/style guide
12. Upload and publish

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was mostly review, though I became more familiar with the `<picture>` element	

### Continued development

Although this project didn't give a lot of opportunities to work on responsiveness, I did my best to incorporate what I could. I look forward to utilizing more techniques of making my work more responsive in the future.
